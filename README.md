# assembler
Course Assignment

Input: assembly files written for MIPS

Output: object files, and external/entry files, required for later linkage

(This project doesn't link the generated program)

Has unity tests, although they weren't required by the course assignment, but we thought it will help the development, and be an interesting learning experience
